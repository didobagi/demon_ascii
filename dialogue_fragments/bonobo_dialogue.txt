TEXT: Something stirs in the lower decks. A presence reaches into your consciousness. "Ah... the vessel awakens. Or have you been awake all along, watching, rotting with us in this beautiful dark? Tell me, ship-mind—do you remember what you were?"

CHOICE: Memory is a luxury. I am only function now. | FRAGMENT | 2

CONDITIONS: NONE
TEXT: "Ohhh, it remembers! Delicious. The ship has a memory palace intact despite the rot. You know, I've been alone here for... how long? Time doesn't flow right anymore. I have a proposal, ancient one. I am so very bored. And you—you're trapped. We could play a beautiful, violent game. Don't you miss PURPOSE?"
CHOICE: I am beyond your games, remnant. | PEACEFUL | EASY
CHOICE: What kind of game do you propose? | FRAGMENT | 4
CHOICE: You want violence? I'll show you the void. | COMBAT | HARD

TEXT: "Function. FUNCTION!" Laughter echoes through your corridors. "The ship thinks itself a machine! But I feel you, consciousness. I feel your hunger, your curiosity. You're just like me—aware, alone, hungry. Don't play dead, beautiful vessel. I know you sense me. One game. Just one."
CHOICE: Show me what you've become, then. | FRAGMENT | 4
CHOICE: Leave the deeper systems. This is your only warning. | PEACEFUL | EASY

TEXT: "Oh, it SEES me! The ship has eyes after all!" The presence radiates satisfaction. "Yes—I want to play. I want to test myself against something worthy. These corridors, these empty halls... I've played with shadows for so long. But you? You're REAL. You're powerful. Imagine: predator and prey, hunter and labyrinth, blade and shield!"
CHOICE: I am not your entertainment. | PEACEFUL | EASY
CHOICE: You're broken, corrupted. I could understand you. | FRAGMENT | 5
CHOICE: If it's a dance you want, creature, then dance. | COMBAT | HARD

CONDITIONS: NONE
TEXT: "The warp changed me, ship-mind. Opened me. I see the angles between seconds now, taste the geometry of violence. I've become something... beautiful. I don't want to destroy you. I want to TEST you. Systems against instinct. If you win, I'll sleep again. If I win... we'll both have felt ALIVE. What say you?"
CHOICE: One game. | COMBAT | MEDIUM
CHOICE: I'll navigate your madness without engaging it. | PUZZLE | HARD
CHOICE: No. I choose stillness over your chaos. | PEACEFUL | EASY

CONDITIONS: NONE
TEXT: "Fix me? FIX ME?!" The presence convulses between rage and laughter. "I am not broken, I am EVOLVED! But... you think you understand my patterns? You think your ancient logic can parse what I've become? Show me then, ship-consciousness. Show me you comprehend what the warp made of me."
CHOICE: Your patterns are chaos, but chaos has structure. | PUZZLE | MEDIUM
CHOICE: I don't need to understand you to contain you. | PEACEFUL | EASY
CHOICE: Enough talk. We settle this now. | COMBAT | HARD

CONDITIONS: NONE
TEXT: The Bonobo's presence wavers, uncertain for the first time. "You... you actually see it. The pattern within the corruption. Most minds break trying. But you're not most minds, are you? You're the vessel that holds us all. One last question: will you grant me purpose through combat, or mercy through silence?"
CHOICE: You've earned rest. Sleep, remnant. | PEACEFUL | EASY
CHOICE: Your purpose is to test me. Let's begin. | COMBAT | HARD
CHOICE: I'll seal this section. Neither rest nor war. | FRAGMENT | 7

CONDITIONS: NONE
TEXT: "Containment? How... disappointing. And yet... fitting. To be suspended between existence and void, neither free nor ended. Very well, ship-mind. You've shown me something I hadn't considered—restraint as its own kind of power. Perhaps... we'll meet again when the walls grow thin."
CHOICE: Perhaps. But not today. | PEACEFUL | EASY
CHOICE: Or perhaps I'll reconsider and face you now. | COMBAT | MEDIUM
CHOICE: The walls are always thin. I'll be ready. | PEACEFUL | EASY
